"""This function checks if a word is alphabetical. A word is alphabetical if letters in the word are in alphabetical order, and is a word from the list of valid words.

For example, if wordList is a list of English words, 'box', 'annoy', and 'chips' are alphabetical words, but 'bat' and 'pack' are not because the letters are not in alphabetical order, and 'abcd', 'aqz' are not because they are not words in the wordList.

Without access to a valid wordList, this function is useless. But, it doesn't have to be that way. Your task is to use default values in the function definition so that users of that function may call it without providing a wordList. If no wordList is provided, the function should treat all words as valid words, but should still return True or False depending on whether the word's letters are in alphabetical order.

For example, isAlphabeticalWord('abcd') should return True but isAlphabeticalWord('zoo') should return False."""

Its not running just see the code for future reference.
